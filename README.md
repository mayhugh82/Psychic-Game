The object of the game is to guess what upper case or lower case letter the computer is thinking of.

    * If you guess the correct letter you wins will go up by one and the game will reset.
    * If you guess incorrectly, the letter you chose will appear next to "Your Guesses So Far".
    * Your losses will go up by one and you "Guesses Left" will go down by one.
2. You get 10 chances to guess the computer's letter then the game will reset.
